# Additional Edge Cases for Future Testing

## 1. Network Connectivity and Offline Behavior
Category: Network Resilience & Error Handling
Priority: High
Test Scenarios:

Offline Message Queuing: Send messages while offline, reconnect, verify messages are sent
Connection Loss During Send: Simulate network loss mid-request, verify graceful handling
Slow Network Responses: Test with 3G/slow connection simulation for timeout handling
Connection Recovery: Verify app recovers properly when connection is restored

### Why This Matters:
Real users frequently experience network issues, especially on mobile devices. The application should handle these gracefully without losing user data or providing confusing feedback.

## 2. Browser Resource Limits and Performance Edge Cases
Category: Performance & Resource Management
Priority: Medium
Test Scenarios:

Maximum Input Length: Test extremely long messages (10k+ characters)
Chat History Limits: Test with 500+ messages in a single chat
Memory Pressure: Simulate low memory conditions
Multiple Tab Behavior: Open multiple tabs, verify state synchronization
Browser Storage Limits: Fill localStorage to capacity, test graceful handling

### Why This Matters:
Users might push the application to its limits through normal usage patterns. Power users could have very long conversations or keep the app open for extended periods.

## 3. Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation
Category: Accessibility & Usability
Priority: Medium-High
Test Scenarios:

Keyboard-Only Navigation: Navigate entire app using only keyboard
Screen Reader Compatibility: Verify ARIA labels and semantic markup
Focus Management: Ensure proper focus handling in modals and navigation
High Contrast Mode: Test with Windows high contrast mode enabled
Reduced Motion: Verify app respects prefers-reduced-motion setting

### Why This Matters:
Accessibility is crucial for inclusive design and legal compliance. Many users rely on keyboard navigation or assistive technologies.
